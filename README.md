# Server

1. Edit `.env` file to set:
    - **DATA_STORE**: **Absolute** path to a folder to store player exploit related files.
    - **USERID**: The `user:group` id tuple to use for ataka. Note that write access write access to both the docker socket and the data directory has to be provided. You'll want to set this to the user id of the owner of the data directory and the group id of the `docker` group.
    - **CTF**: The name of the ctfconfig to use.
2. Edit the ctfconfig in `ataka/ctfconfig/`
3. Run `docker-compose up -d --build`

> The ctfconfig is mounted into the containers. When editing the config while ataka is running, run `./ataka-cli reload` to hot-reload the ctfconfig.

# Player-CLI

The player-cli is a tool written in python to help players interact with *ataka* and create, upload and manage exploits and targets.

## Setup

The player-cli is a `.pyz` file (Python Zipped Executable).

> This only needs to be done once.

- Download the ataka-player-cli through a get request to port 8000 of the api container.
- Save that in a known location (`~/.local/bin/atk`).
- Mark as excecutable

## Reloading Player-CLI

When the ctfconfig is modified and `./ataka-cli reload` is run, the local offline copy of the ctfconfig needs to also be reloaded. For that run:

```bash
$ atk reload
Writing player-cli at <player-cli-location>
```

This overwrites the old player-cli with the new one.

## How to write an exploit

An exploit can be any executable or script.

It will receive two environment variables:
- `TARGET_IP`: the IP to attack;
- `TARGET_EXTRA`: a JSON string containing extra information on the target, such as flag IDs.

Your exploit should print the captured flags.
They will be matched by a regular expression, so the output doesn't have to be clean.

### Create and template a new exploit

```
atk exploit new
```

This asks you for a template. Choose one.

As a next step, it asks you for the directory. If the current directory is empty, it skips this phase and just generates the exploit here, elseways lists the contents and prompts for a path.

Then it asks for the service and exploit name.

Finally it asks for your name. Give your username, or real name; this is for the sysadmin to identify you in case your exploits mess up.

This templates a new directory, creates a remote exploit, and stores the metadata into `.ataka`

### Testing a local exploit

Get the name of your service:

```
$ atk flag ids
[*] Flag IDs for service buffalo
  10.99.0.2 => ["1234", "5678"]
[*] Flag IDs for service swiss_keys
  10.99.0.2 => ["1234", "5678"]
[*] Flag IDs for service to_the_moon
  10.99.0.2 => ["1234", "5678"]
[*] Flag IDs for service kyc
  10.99.0.2 => ["1234", "5678"]
[*] Flag IDs for service gopher_coin
  10.99.0.2 => ["1234", "5678"]
[*] Flag IDs for service wall.eth
  10.99.0.2 => ["1234", "5678"]
[*] Flag IDs for service oly_consensus
  10.99.0.2 => ["1234", "5678"]
```

Run the exploit:

```
$ atk exploit runlocal
```

Where:
- `exploit.py` is your exploit (must be executable);

This will test the exploit against the NOP team: `exploit runlocal` is supposed to be used for testing, not for actual attacks, which should be centralized to allow the captain to manage them.

By default, all output will be shown, to limit this, use the `-l/--limit` flag.

If you only want to run a fixed number of attack rounds, you can use `-c/--count` (e.g., `-c 1` is a one-shot attack).
By default, the command attacks forever until manually terminated.

Instead of an executable, you can also specify a directory containing a Dockerfile.
The runner will try to execute the command from the Dockerfile (locally, outside Docker), with the specified directory as the working directory.
This is useful in combination with `exploit download`, described in the next section.

The local runner can run exploits against the real targets (`--all-targets`, or subsets via `-T/-N`).

### Deploying a centralized exploit

To run on the centralized attacker, exploits must be wrapped in a Docker container and uploaded to the server.

The CLI provides templates for common containers, see the above paragraphs.

If you need it, you can edit the `Dockerfile` to specify e.g. custom versions (e.g., `python:3.12-slim`, `ubuntu:20.04`, and so forth).

To upload your exploit directory:

```
$ atk exploit upload
```

This will take care of uploading the exploit.
It also launches a job against the default target (NOP team) and shows you the output before activating it.
You can check it with `atk exploit ls .`.

Whenever you want to update your exploit to a new version, just issue the `exploit upload` command again.
The attacker will assign progressive numbers to the versions, such as `NAME-1`, `NAME-2`, and so forth.

Uploaded exploits can be downloaded by anyone with `atk exploit download EXPLOIT_ID OUTPUT_DIR`.

### (De)activating exploits

You can use `atk exploit activate/deactivate` to activate/deactivate an exploit.
The commands accepts a history ID or an exploit ID.
Generally, you should use them with history IDs, and use `exploit switch` (see next section) for switching between different versions.

When `exploit activate` gets a history ID, it activates the most recent exploit version in the history.
If an exploit is already active, it does nothing.

When `exploit deactivate` gets a history ID, it deactivates all the exploits in the history.

### Switching exploit versions

List the exploits to find the exploit ID:

```
$ atk exploit ls
...
cool-pwn (buffalo)
    2022-06-04 14:59:11        nickname cool-pwn-1
    2022-06-04 18:15:29        nickname cool-pwn-2
    2022-06-04 18:15:31 ACTIVE nickname cool-pwn-3
...
```

Now switch to the desired version:

```
$ atk exploit switch cool-pwn-1
Deactivate cool-pwn-3
Activate cool-pwn-1
```

We can confirm it worked:

```
$ atk exploit ls
...
cool-pwn (buffalo)
    2022-06-04 14:59:11 ACTIVE nickname cool-pwn-1
    2022-06-04 18:15:29        nickname cool-pwn-2
    2022-06-04 18:15:31        nickname cool-pwn-3
...
```


### Checking exploit logs

You can check logs (including stdout/stderr) for a centralized exploit using `atk exploit logs [NAME]`, where `NAME` is a history or exploit ID.
If you pass an exploit ID, it will show logs for that specific version.
If you pass a history ID, it will show logs for active exploits in the history.
If you pass `auto` or `.`, this resolves to the current exploit directory [`auto` is the default]
You can pass more than one ID and mix exploit and history IDs.

By default, it will show logs from the current round.
You can show logs from the last NUM rounds by passing `-n NUM`.

### Target management

Ataka supports per-history target control.
By default, all targets are enabled.

To see which targets are enabled for a history, use `atk exploit target ls`.
You can enable/disable targets for a history with `atk exploit target on/off` (they both support `--all` to mean "all known targets").

Enabling one or multiple targets also schedules a new job for immediate central execution for the specified target(s), even if said target is already enabled.
You can use this to re-run a central execution if necessary.

## Manual flag submission

You can manually submit flags:

```
$ atk flag submit 'FLAG{foo}' 'FLAG{bar}' ...
```

The flags can be dirty, they will be matched using the flag regex.

If you don't specify flags, `flag submit` will read from stdin until EOF and then submit (i.e., **it is not streaming**):

```
$ echo 'dirtyFLAG{foo}dirtyFLAG{bar}dirty' | atk flag submit
```

## Emergency mode

Invoking the CLI as `atk -b/--bypass-tools ...` will bypass the centralized Ataka service and connect directly to the gameserver to get attack targets, flag IDs and to submit flags.
In this mode, only
- `exploit flag ids`,
- `exploit runlocal` and
- `flag submit` are guaranteed to work.

A typical emergency scenario will involve running exploits locally with `exploit runlocal --all-targets` (and/or `-N/-T` if finer target control is required).
